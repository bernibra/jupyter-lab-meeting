# jupyter-lab-meeting

This is a short tutorial on how to use and create a jupyter notebooks for the ETHZ Plant Ecology group. The making of this tutorial was inspired by the notebooks developed for the module for the Quantitive Approaches to Plant Ecology and Community Ecology during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, in [this notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bernibra/Quantitative-Approaches-practical/master?filepath=index.ipynb), we reproduced the results of [Watts and Strogatz (1998)](https://www.nature.com/articles/30918) on the small-world features presented by several real networked systems.

A jupyter notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating documents that combine text and code that can be run. In order to develop a jupyter notebook for a lecture, we will need basic knowledge of [Git+Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [basic shell commands](https://www-xray.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jss/lecture/computing/notes/out/commands_basic/).

## Install Jupyter and explore how to make a notebook

If you are from ETH, you likely have an expensive MacBook pro; therefore, make sure you have Xcode installed (from App Store). 

Installying *jupyter* to your computer is not difficult, you just need to run basic commands in the terminal of your laptop. *Datacamp* has a [nice tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) on some of the basics regarding Jupyter notebooks. But, in short, you need to run the following commands in the [Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernibra/jupyter-lab-meeting/master/gifs/terminal.gif):



If you are not keen on using the command line, you could consider installing the [graphical installer](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) of Anaconda, and [get jupyter](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/) via their user friendly interface

## Create a Github repository for your lecture

You will need a [Github account](https://github.com/), which is a company that provides free hosting for software development version control using Git. In order to manage Github repositories, you will also need to have Git installed in your computer (version control software that can be [easily installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).

Once you've created a Github account and installed Git in your laptop, you can create a [new public repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and [clone it](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your computer. If you are very uncomfortable using the terminal, you could consider using the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Initializing a notebook in the new repository: add, commit, push and repeat.

Now you have an online repository that

## Build jupyter notebooks in a virtual environment using Binder.

## Add jupyter extensions and interactive tools.
