# jupyter-lab-meeting

This is a short tutorial on how to use and create a jupyter notebooks for the ETHZ Plant Ecology group. The making of this tutorial was inspired by the notebooks developed for the module for the Quantitive Approaches to Plant Ecology and Community Ecology during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, in [this notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bernibra/Quantitative-Approaches-practical/master?filepath=index.ipynb), we reproduced the results of [Watts and Strogatz (1998)](https://www.nature.com/articles/30918) on the small-world features presented by several real networked systems.

A jupyter notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating documents that combine text and code that can be run. In order to develop a jupyter notebook for a lecture, we will need basic knowledge of [Git+Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [basic shell commands](https://www-xray.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jss/lecture/computing/notes/out/commands_basic/).

## Create a Github repository for your lecture

You will first need a [Github account](https://github.com/), which is a company that provides free hosting for software development version control using Git. In order to manage Github repositories, you will also need to have Git installed in your computer (version control software that can be [easily installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)). If you are from ETH, you likely have an expensive MacBook pro; therefore, make sure you have Xcode installed (from App Store).

Once you've created a Github account and installed Git in your laptop, you can create a [new public repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and [clone it](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your computer. If you are very uncomfortable using the terminal, you could consider using the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
