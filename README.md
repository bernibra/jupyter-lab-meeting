# jupyter-lab-meeting

This is a short tutorial on how to use and create a jupyter notebooks for the ETHZ Plant Ecology group. The making of this tutorial was inspired by the notebooks developed for the module for the Quantitive Approaches to Plant Ecology and Community Ecology during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, in [this notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bernibra/Quantitative-Approaches-practical/master?filepath=index.ipynb), we reproduced the results of [Watts and Strogatz (1998)](https://www.nature.com/articles/30918) on the small-world features presented by several real networked systems.
